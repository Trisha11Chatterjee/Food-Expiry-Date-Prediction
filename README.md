Untitled8 : Data Augmentation code

Data augmentation and object classification are key techniques in food-related projects. In this context, data augmentation can help create a more diverse dataset, improving model robustness for food image classification. Common augmentations like rotations, flips, brightness adjustments, or even simulating different lighting conditions can make models more reliable in real-world scenarios.

Object classification in food can span various applications, from identifying specific food items to classifying food freshness levels. These skills will be highly relevant in tasks like automated food quality checks, calorie estimation, and smart grocery systems.
